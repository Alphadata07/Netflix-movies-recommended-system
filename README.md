🎬 Netflix Movie Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System inspired by Netflix. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze user preferences and recommend movies with similar characteristics.

The system is trained on a Netflix dataset and recommends movies based on content similarity (genres, descriptions, cast, etc.).

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data handling

NumPy – Numerical computation

Scikit-learn – Model building & vectorization

Cosine Similarity – To measure similarity between movies

Streamlit / Flask (optional) – For building an interactive web app

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information about Netflix movies such as:

Movie Title

Genre

Description / Overview

Cast & Crew

Ratings

👉 You can get a Netflix dataset from Kaggle or other public sources.

⚙️ How It Works

Data Preprocessing – Clean the dataset (remove duplicates, handle missing values).

Feature Extraction – Convert text features (overview, genre, cast) into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.

Similarity Calculation – Use Cosine Similarity to compute closeness between movies.

Recommendation – When a user selects a movie, the system returns top-N similar movies.
